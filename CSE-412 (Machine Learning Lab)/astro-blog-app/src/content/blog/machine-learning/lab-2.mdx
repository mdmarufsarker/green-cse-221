## Lab Task 

- 1 - 10000 -> tax 5%
- 10001 - 50000 -> tax 10%
- 50001 - 100000 -> tax 20%
- over 100000 -> tax 30%

```py
income = int(input())

def calcParcent(income, p):
    return income * p

def tax(prev, curr):
    print(prev + curr)
    return None

if income < 0:
    print("Wrong Input")
else:
    tax = 0
    if income <= 10000:
        tax = calcParcent(10000, .05)
        print(tax)
    elif income <= 50000:
        prev = calcParcent(10000, .05)
        curr = (income - 10000) * .10
        tax(prev, curr)
    elif income <= 100000:
        prev = calcParcent(10000, .05) + calcParcent(40000, .10)
        curr = (income - 50000) * .20
        tax(prev, curr)
    else:
        prev = calcParcent(10000, .05) + calcParcent(40000, .10) + calcParcent(50000, .20)
        curr = (income - 100000) * .30
        tax(prev, curr)
```

## Softwares:

- Jupyter Notebook
- Anaconda
- Google Colab
    - T4 GPU for Machine Learning Projects
    - Have limitations (Gives less time)
- Kaggle
    - Gives more time than Google Colab

## KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors)

KNN, or k-Nearest Neighbors, is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by classifying a new data point based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors in the feature space. In essence, it assumes that similar data points are located near each other. 

`Scikit-learn < tensorflow < pytorch`

## Iris Dataset

```py
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

dataset = load_iris()

print(dataset.feature_names)

print(dataset.target_names)

print(len(dataset(['data']))) # 150

# input -> x
# output -> y

x = dataset['data']
y = dataset['target']

print(dataset.keys())

for i in range(5):
    print(f'{x[i]} -> {y[i]}')

for i in range(1,6):
    print(f'{x[-i]} -> {y[-i]}')
```
