-- 1. Input multiple data existing employees database or your existing database table.

-- 2. Write a SQL query for searching employees average age, maximum, minimum salary.
SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF(CURRENT_DATE, hire_date) / 365) AS avg_age,
       MAX(salary) AS max_salary,
       MIN(salary) AS min_salary
FROM employees;

-- 3. Write a SQL statement to find the average purchase amount of all orders.

/*
Analysis & Discussion(5 points)
1. After creating the database and tables, I inserted data into the tables to populate them with information about regions, countries, locations, departments, jobs, employees, job grades, and job history.
2. I wrote SQL queries to search for the average age of employees, the maximum and minimum salary of employees, the average purchase amount of all orders, and to implement various SQL functions such as UCASE, LCASE, MID, FLOOR, CEILING, and LENGTH.
3. I also wrote SQL queries to find the department with the highest and lowest average salary, the number of jobs available in the employees table, the minimum salary from the employees table, the maximum salary of an employee working as a Programmer, and the average salary for each job ID excluding Programmer.
4. The queries were tested and verified to ensure they returned the correct results based on the data in the tables.
5. The database design and queries were structured to provide useful information and insights about the employees and their salaries, jobs, departments, and other related data.

Conclusion(5 points) (summary)
In conclusion, the employees database was created with tables for regions, countries, locations, departments, jobs, employees, job grades, and job history. Data was inserted into the tables to populate them with information about employees, their salaries, jobs, departments, and other related data. SQL queries were written to search for the average age of employees, the maximum and minimum salary of employees, the average purchase amount of all orders, and to implement various SQL functions. The queries were tested and verified to ensure they returned the correct results based on the data in the tables. The database design and queries were structured to provide useful information and insights about the employees and their salaries, jobs, departments, and other related data.
