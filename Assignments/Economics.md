## Chapter 1

- What are the two main causes of market failure? Give an example of each.

Answer: The two main causes of market failure are externalities and market power.

1. Externalities: Externalities are the costs or benefits of a market activity that affect a third party. For example, a factory that produces pollution that affects the health of nearby residents.
2. Market power: Market power is the ability of a firm to charge a price greater than marginal cost. For example, a monopoly that charges a price greater than marginal cost.

- What does the “invisible hand” of the marketplace do?

Answer: The invisible hand of the marketplace is the tendency of market prices to direct individuals pursuing their own interests to engage in activities that promote the economic well-being of society.

- How are inflation and unemployment related in the short run?

Answer: In the short run, inflation and unemployment are negatively related. When inflation is high, unemployment is low. When inflation is low, unemployment is high.

- The company that you manage has invested $5 million in developing a new product, but the development is not quite finished. At a recent meeting, your salespeople report that the introduction of competing products has reduced the expected sales of your new product to $3 million. If it would cost $1 million to finish development and make the product, should you go ahead and do so? What is the most that you should pay to complete development?

Answer: Given that,

The expected sales of the new product have been reduced to $3 million and it would cost an additional $1 million to finish development and make the product, we can calculate the potential profit.

Potential profit = Expected sales - Development cost
                 = $3 million - $1 million
                 = $2 million

In this scenario, completing development and making the product would yield a potential profit of $2 million.

However, it's also essential to consider the initial investment of $5 million in developing the new product. Since this cost has already been incurred and cannot be recovered, it doesn't directly factor into the decision to continue the development.

As for the maximum amount that should be paid to complete development, it would be prudent for the company to spend an amount less than or equal to the potential profit. Therefore, the maximum amount that should be paid to complete development would ideally be less than $2 million.

So, The company should not go ahead and finish development. The company should not pay more than $1 million to complete development.

- What principle is applicable to the scenario, “where favorable weather conditions result in a substantial increase in mango production, leading to a decrease in mango prices and higher mango consumption”? Provide two different examples that illustrate the same economic principle.

Answer: The principle of supply and demand is applicable to the scenario. The principle of supply and demand states that the price of a good adjusts to bring the quantity supplied and quantity demanded for that good into balance.

Two different examples that illustrate the same economic principle are:

1. Oil Production and Prices: When oil production from major oil-producing countries increases due to technological advancements or political stability, the supply of oil in the global market increases. As a result, the price of oil tends to decrease, leading to higher oil consumption by industries and consumers.

2. Technology and Electronics: Advancements in technology often lead to increased production of electronic devices such as smartphones and tablets. With more units available in the market, the prices of these electronic devices tend to decrease, spurring higher consumption and demand from consumers.

In each of these examples, the law of supply and demand is observed, where an increase in supply leads to a decrease in price and subsequently higher consumption.

- Suppose you have just completed your secondary level education and are looking for a university where you want to complete your graduation. After analyzing most of the universities in your area, you have decided to be a graduate of computer science engineering from Green University of Bangladesh. What might be the incentives for you to select the CSE program at Green University? List some of the benefits and costs (marginal analysis) involved in your decision. Would your choice be rational?

Answer: Selecting the Computer Science Engineering (CSE) program at Green University of Bangladesh might present several incentives:

Benefits:

1. Quality Education: Green University of Bangladesh may offer a high-quality education in the field of computer science engineering with experienced faculty and modern facilities.
2. Industry Connections: The university might have partnerships with industry leaders, offering opportunities for internships, networking, and future employment prospects.

1. Tuition and Fees: The financial cost of attending Green University's CSE program, including tuition, fees, and potential student loans.
2. Time Investment: The time commitment required to complete the program, impacting opportunities for immediate entry into the workforce.
3. Opportunity Cost: The potential earnings forfeited during the period of study, as well as alternative educational or career paths that could be pursued.
4. Relocation and Living Expenses: If applicable, the costs associated with relocating to the university's location and living expenses during the course of study.

While the decision to pursue the CSE program at Green University of Bangladesh involves weighing potential benefits against associated costs, whether this choice is rational ultimately depends on the individual's preferences, priorities, and circumstances. If the perceived benefits, such as the quality education, industry connections, and specialized curriculum, outweigh the financial and time-related costs, the decision to enroll in the program at Green University could indeed be considered rational. However, each individual's circumstances and values will influence the ultimate rationality of their decision.

## Chapter 4

- Define the equilibrium of a market. Describe the forces that move a market toward its equilibrium?

Answer: The equilibrium of a market is the point at which the quantity demanded is equal to the quantity supplied. At this point, there is no shortage or surplus of the good in the market.

The forces that move a market toward its equilibrium are the forces of supply and demand. When the quantity demanded is greater than the quantity supplied, there is a shortage of the good in the market. This shortage causes the price to rise, which in turn reduces the quantity demanded and increases the quantity supplied. As a result, the market moves toward equilibrium.

When the quantity supplied is greater than the quantity demanded, there is a surplus of the good in the market. This surplus causes the price to fall, which in turn reduces the quantity supplied and increases the quantity demanded. As a result, the market moves toward equilibrium.

- “An increase in the demand for notebooks raises the quantity of notebooks demanded but not the quantity supplied.” Is this statement true or false? Explain.

Answer: This statement is true. An increase in the demand for notebooks raises the quantity of notebooks demanded but not the quantity supplied. This is because the quantity supplied is determined by the price of the good, while the quantity demanded is determined by the price of the good and other factors such as income, tastes, and the prices of related goods.

- Over the past 40 years, technological advances have reduced the cost of computer chips. How do you think this has affected the market for computers? For computer software? For typewriters?

Answer: Over the past 40 years, technological advances have reduced the cost of computer chips. This has likely affected the market for computers, computer software, and typewriters in the following ways:

1. Computers: The reduction in the cost of computer chips has likely increased the supply of computers, leading to lower prices and higher quantities sold.
2. Computer Software: The reduction in the cost of computer chips has likely increased the supply of computer software, leading to lower prices and higher quantities sold.
3. Typewriters: The demand for typewriters has likely decreased, leading to lower prices and lower quantities sold.

- Ketchup is a complement (as well as a condiment) for hot dogs. If the price of hot dogs rises, what happens in the market for ketchup? For tomatoes? For tomato juice? For orange juice?

Answer: If the price of hot dogs rises, the market for ketchup, tomatoes, tomato juice, and orange juice are likely to be affected in the following ways:

1. Ketchup: The demand for ketchup decreases, leading to lower prices and lower quantities sold.
2. Tomatoes: The demand for tomatoes decreases, leading to lower prices and lower quantities sold.
3. Tomato Juice: The demand for tomato juice decreases, leading to lower prices and lower quantities sold.
4. Orange Juice: The demand for orange juice increases, leading to higher prices and higher quantities sold.

Overall, the demand for ketchup, tomatoes, and tomato juice decreases, while the demand for orange juice increases. This is because ketchup, tomatoes, and tomato juice are complements for hot dogs, while orange juice is a substitute for hot dogs.

## Chapter 5

- If the elasticity is greater than 1, is demand elastic or inelastic? If the elasticity equals zero, is demand perfectly elastic or perfectly inelastic?

Answer: If the price elasticity of demand is greater than 1, the demand is considered elastic. This means that a change in price results in a proportionally larger change in quantity demanded.

If the elasticity equals zero, the demand is perfectly inelastic. This indicates that quantity demanded does not change in response to changes in price, resulting in a vertical demand curve.

- List and explain the four determinants of the price elasticity of demand.

Answer: The price elasticity of demand refers to how the quantity demanded of a good or service responds to a change in price. The four main determinants of price elasticity of demand are:

1. Availability of Close Substitutes:
   When close substitutes are readily available for a good or service, consumers can easily switch to alternatives if the price of the original product changes. In this case, the demand tends to be more elastic, as consumers are more responsive to price changes.

2. Necessity vs. Luxury:
   Goods and services can be classified as either necessities or luxuries. Necessities, such as basic food items or essential medications, tend to have inelastic demand, as consumers require them regardless of price changes. Conversely, luxury items, such as high-end cars or expensive jewelry, generally have more elastic demand as consumers can easily forgo or postpone their purchase in response to price changes.

3. Proportion of Income Spent:
   The proportion of a consumer's income spent on a good or service influences its price elasticity of demand. Goods or services that represent a significant portion of a consumer's budget tend to have more elastic demand, as consumers are more sensitive to price changes for these items. Conversely, goods that represent a small portion of a consumer's budget tend to have inelastic demand.

4. Time Horizon:
   The time available for consumers to adjust their purchasing behavior in response to price changes also affects price elasticity of demand. In the short run, demand for many goods and services may be inelastic, as consumers may not easily adjust their purchasing habits. However, in the long run, consumers may have more flexibility to find substitutes, adjust their consumption patterns, or seek alternatives, leading to more elastic demand.

These determinants collectively determine how responsive consumers are to changes in price, influencing the elasticity of demand for a particular good or service.

- If the actual price in this market were above the equilibrium price, what would drive the market toward the equilibrium?

Answer: If the actual price in this market were above the equilibrium price, there would be a surplus of the good in the market. This would cause the price to fall, which in turn would reduce the quantity supplied and increase the quantity demanded. As a result, the market would move toward equilibrium.

- If the actual price in this market were below the equilibrium price, what would drive the market toward the equilibrium?

Answer: If the actual price in this market were below the equilibrium price, there would be a shortage of the good in the market. This would cause the price to rise, which in turn would increase the quantity supplied and reduce the quantity demanded. As a result, the market would move toward equilibrium.

1. "There is 70% sell going on BATA, for this decision which BATA takes, their selling increased almost twice"- which principle is relevant to this statement? Explain with two more real-life examples.

Ans: The principle of opportunity cost is relevant to this statement. The principle of opportunity cost states that the cost of something is what you give up to get it.

Two more real-life examples of the principle of opportunity cost are:

1. A student who chooses to spend time studying for an exam instead of going out with friends. The opportunity cost of studying is the time spent with friends.
2. A company that chooses to invest in a new product instead of expanding its existing product line. The opportunity cost of investing in the new product is the potential revenue from expanding the existing product line.

- Suppose Mr. Z is a student at the Green University of Bangladesh. As a rational person, it is the best decision for him to choose GUB as a quality education at an affordable price. Now as a household how his economic activities are connected to the overall economy, explain using the circular flow diagram.

Answer: As a student at the Green University of Bangladesh, Mr. Z's economic activities are connected to the overall economy in the following ways:

1. Mr. Z's tuition payments to the university contribute to the university's revenue, which is a part of the circular flow of income.
2. Mr. Z's education at the university will likely lead to higher future earnings, which will contribute to the circular flow of income.
3. Mr. Z's education will also likely lead to higher productivity, which will contribute to the circular flow of goods and services.

Law of supply: The law of supply states that the quantity supplied of a good rises when the price of the good rises, all else equal.
Example: When the price of a good increases, producers are willing to supply more of the good to the market.

Law of demand: The law of demand states that the quantity demanded of a good falls when the price of the good rises, all else equal.
Example: When the price of a good increases, consumers are willing to purchase less of the good.
